We mocked up a design with a mockup app.  We figured it would be easier to come up with a design that worked insted of 
winging it and having to write the code over many times.  The object in this system are the same ones from phase 1.  Other
classes were added to break the code up and make it easier to understand.

Challenges were enourmous as we had to learn how to build an interface, how to save objects and how to make the interface
interact with the objects from the previous phase.  One part that was difficult was saving the records to file.  It wasn't that
the implementation part was hard but we actually needed to save to seperate files one for customers and one for accounts because
of the extra features we added to the program.

All parts of what you asked for were implemented along with several that were not asked for.  For instance we added a way
to add existing customers to new accounts or to create new customers.  There are currently no known bugs.  There are no specific
procedures to running the system.  We created a tab system and tried to make everything intuitive as possible.  Each tab was 
designed to be easy to figure out.  One thing we would have changed if there was more time was the create tab.  It is nice and 
intuitive but I felt that it could have been laid out better.  I have included a mock up (Mockup2.jpg) of what I think a better layout would be,
but at this point it would take a couple hours to redo that and there simply isn't time.

Overall we both enjoyed the project and learned a lot.
